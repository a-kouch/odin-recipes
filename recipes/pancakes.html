    <h2>The fluffiest pancakes you will ever eat</h2>
        <p>The Japanese have <em>perfected</em> this simple, yet exciting fluffy pancake recipe that anyone can make. So delicious, you might eat it without butter or syrup. Enjoy! Serve this right from the griddle or pan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul></p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended.</li>
                <li>Mix flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Slowly mix into the sugar-egg mixture; batter will thicken rather quickly. Slowly add milk. Stir in vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            </ol>
